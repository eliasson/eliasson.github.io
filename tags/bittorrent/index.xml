      <title>A BitTorrent client in Python 3.5</title>

      <description>When Python 3.5 was released together with the new module asyncio I was curios to give it a try. Recently I decided to implement a simple BitTorrent client using asyncio - I have always been interested in peer-to-peer protocols and it seemed like a perfect fit.
The project is named Pieces, all of the source code is available at GitHub and released under the Apache 2 license. Feel free to learn from it, steal from it, improve it, laugh at it or just ignore it.</description>

      <description>In Python 3.4 a new module, asyncio was introduced, this module allows you to write concurrent, single threaded code in Python without relying on any third-party libraries (such as Twisted, or Tornado).
I plan to take this new module for a test run, implementing a simple BitTorrent client. But first lets see how we can write concurrent code in Python 3.5.
Remember, concurrency is not the same as parallelism.</description>

      <description>I am in my mid thirties and like many of my peers I need to take som action to stay(?) cool. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t fancy running a marathon, nor do I have the money to buy me a brand new car - my only choice is to learn a new programming language.
My choices were Scala, Clojure or Go. I already done some work in Clojure (which I really enjoyed) so that was out.</description>
